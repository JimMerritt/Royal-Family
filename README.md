# Royal Family

Rules summary:

Game Objectives:
A player is victorious if their opponent has no active castles in play.

Setup:

Remove the Ace of Spades and Ace of Hearts from the deck. These are the starting castles. The remaining cards are shuffled and set between the two players. The top three cards are turned face-up and are set next to the deck of remaining cards. This is where play begins.

The play area will consist of each player’s castles, any fortification currently in play, members of the royal family and any captured opposition family members. Between the two players, there will be a deck of all remaining cards, referred to as the draw pile, three face-up piles of cards and a face-down discard pile. If the joker is in play, it is set next to the draw pile or somewhere between the two players where it is easily noticeable.

Turn Order:

The basis of the game is the struggle between those with power and those without. There will be periods of revolution followed by periods of oppression. Each round will see one player with two turns and one player with one turn. This is determined by the cards flopped at the beginning of each round. Play will go as follows:

- Each round begins with three cards being flipped face-up onto the three piles next to the draw pile.
- The color with the fewest cards showing from these three cards gets first turn. This is the age of revolution.
- The player with the fewest cards completes their first turn by drawing a card from either the draw pile or by taking a top card from one of the face-up piles. The card drawn by the player determines what actions they can take. When the player completes their action, it ends their first turn.
- The opposing player does the same: draws a card and completes an action.
- Finally, the original player that had the fewest cards showing during the flop takes their second turn.
- Following the completion of three total turns, a new round begins and three new cards are flopped.
- A new play order is again determined by what color has the lowest number of cards showing. That player goes first and third for this round.

Since this game is all about the balance of revolution and oppression, it only makes sense that the oppressors will get their day as well. The difference in the season of oppression is that the player with the majority of cards in the flop is given the first turn. Aside from this, all other turn mechanics are the same.

The age of oppression comes when the first joker is revealed. This can happen either by drawing from the draw pile, or during the flop. As soon as a joker comes out when there is not one already, the change happens. If this happens during the flop, turn order is determined by the majority. If this happens during a standard turn, turn order for the next round is determined by the majority.

A few notes:

- If the joker is pulled during the flop, move it to the area it will stay and replace the joker with another card from the draw pile.
- If the joker is drawn from the draw pile during a player’s turn, that player cannot draw another card. The joker cannot be discarded by that player and must be put into play immediately.
- If a joker is currently in play and the next joker comes out, the age of oppression ends and we return to the age of revolution. This age of revolution will stay in place until another joker is drawn.


Game Concepts:

Castles: Castles mark the strength of a player’s family. There are four total castles to be built, each represented by an Ace. Spades and Clubs are one alliance, Hearts and Diamonds another. Play begins with one castle being owned by each player. Players can also build a new castle if they gather their cards and families.

Castles take damage when they are attacked and there are no fortified troops in place to protect it. When a castle takes twenty total damage, it is destroyed and removed from the game, along with any current family members in the castle of the same suit. When a player has no active castles, they lose the game.

Troops: Troops are represented by the number cards, ranging from 3 to 10. These troops can be used to attack an opponent’s castle, or to defend your own. When attacking, if there is a fortification in place within your opponent’s castle, it must be cleared before any damage can be done to the castle. Troop cards can only be used if you control a castle of the same suit. They can be used from the draw pile or from the face-up piles, but they cannot persist through turns. When a troop card is drawn or picked up, it must be used the same turn or discarded.

Each troop card has a value. This value is based on the number of the card. The value of a Three of Hearts is three. The value of the Ten of Hearts is ten. When attacking, this value determines the damage that will be done to whatever is being attacked. This value will also determine the strength of a fortification.

Attacks: When using troops to attack, their attack value is based on their numeric value for that card. If an attack does not result in the destruction of its target, the attacking troop card will remain by that target until destroyed. If an attack does meet or exceed the value of its target, the attacking troops and the target card are both discarded face-down in the discard pile.

Fortifications: When troops are used to fortify a castle, they are set in front of that castle. If there is a fortification in place, the castle cannot be attacked, and therefore, cannot be damaged.

A few notes:

- The fortification can only be built for a castle of the same suit. Fortifications cannot be set for alliance castles.
- When a fortification is attacked with a lower value card, that damage stays. The card should be placed over the fortification card until the fortification is destroyed.
- When a fortification takes enough damage to bring the value to 0 or below, it is destroyed. The fortification, along with any persistent damage cards by the fortification, will be discarded face-down in the discard pile.

Each castle can only have one fortification in place at any time. If a player decides they would like to upgrade their fortifications, the original one must be removed and discarded, along with any persistent damage for that fortification. The new card is then put into place.

Attacking the Castle: Aside from the Royal Family rules, which will be covered below, attacking a castle is pretty straight-forward. If there is no fortification in place for their opposition’s castle, and a player has a number card matching their own suit available from either drawing from the draw pile, or from picking up a face-up card, that player may use that card to attack. If damage is done to the castle, the attacking troop card is set next to the castle to demonstrate damage has been done. That specific number card will stay in that same spot until the castle is destroyed. A castle is destroyed when there is at least 20 damage done to the castle. This 20 damage can be achieved with any combination of troop cards as long as the total is at least 20.

The Royal Family:
A player’s Royal Family has multiple purposes. The primary purpose of all family members is allowing a player to damage their opponents castle. A player may attack a castle at any time (as long as there are no fortifications in place), the reasons for which are below. A player may not damage a castle, however, unless there is at least one royal family member in the castle of the attacker.


————————————



The Twos!!

2's were assassins. A player could use any face up two to remove one family member from the board.
If a player drew a two, they had to remove one of their own family members from the board. If they did not have a family member active, their castle took one damage.
A player could not pick up a face-up two unless their opponent had an active family member.
The Number Cards!!

Number cards from 3 - 9 were used to either attack your opponent or to fortify your own castle. Players could only use number cards of suits that matched an active castle they owned.
Fortifications were the value of the number card. Attacking cards were the value of that card. There were no bonuses or penalties.
There could only be one fortification per castle.
A castle could not be attacked while a fortification was in place.
The Family Members!!

Family members were only picked up by the players who owned a castle of their suit. When face up, they were not kidnapped.
You could not pick up your opponent's face cards. If you drew your opponent's face cards, you had to discard them (usually very reluctantly!!)
The number of family members determined the attack strength against castles but not fortifications.
Family members could be captured when a castle took damage. They could also be rescued when damaging a castle.
There was no limit to the number of family members able to be captured and held in one castle.
Aces and Tens!!

The remaining Ace and Ten cards were put into circulation in the draw deck.
You could not pick up your opponent's Ace or Ten if they were face up. If you drew your opponents Ace or Ten, you had to discard it.
A player could not pick up their Ten until they had their Ace of the same suit.
An Ace did not become an active castle until a player had both the Ace and the Ten.
Recap

Overall

Everything went really well. The combat was balanced and the cards were balanced. There was a definite streak of bad luck for a couple people but overall it was very successful. One aspect I didn't think about until playing was that there was a slight shift when one player had a ton of cards in play (like a fort, castles, family members, etc.) and the other did not. It affects the pool of cards slightly so as to offer a nice balance. Doesn't really affect anything, but it was noticeable during play.

The Twos!!!!!!

Oh man, those twos! They were frustratingly impactful across all games. Having them as both an attack oriented assassination as well as the blind pickup of the twos made it so the twos became the cards with the most 'character'. They impact the face-up cards, the blind draws and the family member strategies. Making it so a player could use them no matter the suit made them even better.

All in all, I really enjoyed the twos. They added a lot to the games played and their impact was palpable. It felt like they were in a really good spot.

Forts and Attacking

This system functioned pretty well. The games took some time to develop and it was rare to have someone get completely destroyed with no chance of winning. Even in one of the more lopsided games, it came down to a string of very, very bad luck to finally make it so he didn't have a chance.

Overall, these seemed to work. Forcing a player to choose between defending and attacking makes it very dynamic. No one came up with a dominant strategy of 'always leave your castle open' or 'always play the top fortification card' or anything like that. There were some significant choices each player had to make based on their situation.

The Turn Order

Loved the system you came up with. It works so well, adding that extra dimension of staggered turns. The only drawback was one of the major areas of concern:

It became very, very easy to lose track of whose turn it was and when to flop the three cards.

We began using a system of passing the deck back and forth. When a player went first, they would have the deck in front of them. After their second turn, they would flop the cards and pass the deck to the other player, who would then go first. Following that player's second turn, they would flop the cards and hand the deck back to the original player, who would then go first.

This seemed to help a bit. There may be no way around this since the turn order system is awesome and adds so much depth to it, but it's something to think through. Ultimately, I don't think there's a way to force players to keep track of the turns, but it would be cool to offer a solution that we find useful. All in all, this was the only frustrating part of gameplay.

Royal Family

These guys were underwhelming. I'm not sure the best way to solve that. The twos were so impactful and memorable, these guys were just like, 'meh, another face card I guess'. Their biggest impact was the ability to attack the opponent's castle.

I'm not sure about the abilities. I love the idea of abilities, but playing without them felt very very comfortable. There just wasn't anything that made the face cards unique. Adding abilities might complicate it to a less comfortable level. But, that could also add some more depth to the game. Not sure. I'd love to hash out some ability concepts and test them out.

Kidnapping and Rescue

This section kind of relates to the previous.

I kept the lackadaisical kidnap and rescue in place from when I played with Kelly and the same issues came up. I agree there has to be a limit to it, and having the single member capacity limit could help. It wasn't overly difficult to remove family members, really. It seemed more difficult to keep them, actually, so maybe your original idea of capacity is really what is needed.

Maybe for attacks, if you have a King, you can kill a King. And a Queen can kill a Queen, and Jack a Jack. Something like that. Here are my concerns:

Being able to remove all family members from your opponent's castle limits them to not being able to do much of anything. That could be really frustrating.
Being able to hold all your opponent's family members made it so they couldn't win. If all their family members were kidnapped, they couldn't attack the castle, and therefore couldn't get them back without having another castle from which they could attack.
Kidnapping is fun, but maybe it's better to push the cards back into circulation. Maybe you can kidnap one family member, and all other attacks will kill a family member. That would guarantee one player couldn't stagnate when all their family members were captured, but it could also allow the removal of an opponents family members without requiring a two.
Ideas for Jokers

Jokers can be a really fun wild card somehow. The only thing I can think of is an assassin you can hold onto. Draw a Joker and keep it in your castle until you want to send it out to remove a family member. The twos require immediate action and can be covered up. The Jokers would be persistent.

I also like the idea of interrupting your opponent's action or family ability, when we get those in place.

Maybe each player begins with one Joker. When they use that Joker for ................, the Joker is discarded and will reenter play like normal. Then, if a player draws the Joker, they can hold onto it to do ............ again. (The dots mean I don't know what they could be used for : ) )

Anyway!!

Enough rambling. Overall, everything went really well. The big concerns were the difficulty in keeping our turns straight and the underwhelming aspect of the Royal Family cards. The turn order might just be par for the course, but finding a way to make the Royal Family more impactful based on what is in your castle will improve engagement quite a bit. That would make assassination targets more important, captures and kidnappings more important, and card selection more important. Overall, that will probably be the biggest challenge since everything else ran really well and balanced.

If I missed anything, I'll let you know.

## This is the old setup

Two royal families race to destroy each other. An open source table top game that requires only a normal deck of cards.

**This game is designed for two players.**

### Setup
1. Get a normal 52 count card deck. Keep the Jokers in the deck.
1. Each player starts with a castle (Ace card) and a hit point tracker (Ten card):
  - Player One starts with a black castle placed in front of them (Ace of Spades). They then place their hit point marker (Ten of Spades) in front of their castle. This is the Darklein family, their crest is the Spade &#9824;. The crest of their alliance family is the Club &#9827;.
  - Player Two starts with a red castle placed in front of them (Ace of Hearts). They then place their hit point marker (Ten of Hearts) in front of their castle. This is the Bludgein family, their crest is the Heart &#9825;. The crest of their alliance family is the Diamond &#9826;.
1. Shuffle the remaining cards.
1. Place three cards face-up. First turn is decided by these cards. Whichever color has a minority in these three cards gets first turn.

### Objective
Destroy all opponent castles. If a player has no castles active, they lose.

### Turn Order

This is a game of oppression and revolution. Each round, there will be a shift in power. This means one turn will have the Darklein family having more power, the next round the Bludgein family.

The game is divided into rounds. Between each round, three new cards are drawn from the deck. These are placed on each face-up pile. A round consists of three turns. Each player takes either one or two turns during a round. Turn order is as follows:
- Whichever player has a minority in the first drawn cards gets first turn. This will be *Player A*.
- *Player A* will take their turn. They can choose to pick up a face-up card or draw from the deck. Based on the card drawn, *Player A* will have options on what action to take (see actions below).
- Following *Player A's* actions, *Player B* will also either pick up one of the face-up cards or draw from the deck. They will also complete an action based on the card drawn.
- Following *Player B's* actions, *Player A* will again take their turn, the same process as before.
- Once three turns have been completed, three cards are drawn from the deck and placed face-up on the three piles. This starts a new round.
- Since *Player A* had two turns the previous round, *Player B* will now have two turns. This round, therefore, starts with *Player B* choosing a card, completing an action, followed by *Player A* doing the same, then *Player B* again.
- Following the three completed turns, three cards are again drawn, one placed face-up on each pile.
- Play continues on in this manner until either player has no castles in play.

### Game Concepts

##### Castles
The objective of the game is to destroy your opponent's castles. Castles are destroyed when their matching hit point card is reduced to zero. In order to reduce the value of the hit point card, an attacker must draw a card that allows them to attack while they have Royal Family members in their own castle and while the castle being attacked has no fortifications.

##### Fortifications
Fortifications can be placed in front of a castle to protect it from being attacked. If there is a fortification in place, a castle can take no damage. Fortifications are represented by number cards and are of the same value. Each castle can have one fortification in place. When attacked, the value of the fortification is reduced by the value of the attacker's card. When a fortification takes enough damage to reduce the value to zero, the fortification is destroyed and discarded.

##### Royal Family
Royal Families are the King, Queen, and Jack of a specific suit. A Royal Family can only reside in a castle of their corresponding suit. Having one of the cards in your castle allows you to damage your opponent's castle. The damage done is based not on the attacking troops, but on the number of Royal Family currently in your castle.

**Example:** The Darklein family currently has their Queen and Jack residing in the castle. The Bludgein family has no fortified troops in place and the Darkleins are able to attack. Since the Bludgein family cannot defend the attack, their castle takes two damage – one for the Queen and one for the Jack. The Bludgein player reduces their castle hit points from ten to eight.

In addition to determining attack strength, the Royal Family cards bring with them abilities which can be performed during a player turn. *These are in the works*

### Game Play Mechanics

Rounds consist of three turns. A player will take one or two turns during a round. Between each round, a new card is drawn from the deck and placed face-up on each pile.

**Turn Order Sample:**
1. Game begins with *Player A* having minority of drawn cards. Takes first turn.
1. *Player B* takes turn two.
1. *Player A* takes turn three.
1. Three new cards are drawn and placed on the face-up piles. One card on each pile.
1. *Player B* takes the first turn.
1. *Player A* takes the second turn.
1. *Player B* takes the third turn.
1. Three new cards are drawn and placed on the face-up piles. One card on each pile.
1. *Player A* will take first turn, then *Player B*, then *Player A*.
1. Play continues in this fashion until either player has no castles in play.

##### On a player's turn they can do the following:

1. Draw: Take one card from either the deck or one of the face-up piles. Available actions are based on the card drawn.
2. Use an ability.

### Actions

##### Number Card Actions (3–9):

Number cards represent the troops of a given family. These troops can be sent out against an opponent, or can be used to fortify a castle. A player may use a number card ranging from 3 to 9 if that number card **matches the suit of a castle the player currently has active**.

- **Fortify a castle:** A player may use a number card ranging from 3 to 9 to fortify the castle of the same suit. A castle may only have one fortification in place at any point. If a castle has a fortification already in place, the player may discard that fortification and replace it with the drawn card. The castle must be active to hold a fortification.<br /><br />Fortifications can be attacked. When this happens, the value of the fortification is reduced from the value of the number card by the amount of the attacker's number card. When a fortification reaches a value of zero (or below), it is destroyed and placed in a face-down discard pile.

- **Attack a fortification:** If your opponent has a fortification in place, you may use your troops to attack their fortification. The value of the attack is determined by the card being used to attack. The opponent's fortification is reduced by that amount. Following the attack, the attacking card is destroyed and placed in the face-down discard pile. If the fortification value is reduced to zero (or below), it is also destroyed and placed in the face-down discard pile.

- **Attack a castle:** If your opponent does not have a fortification in place and you currently have at least one member of your Royal Family residing in the attacking castle, you may attack their castle. Damage done to an opponent's castle is determined not by the value of your troops card, but by the number of Royal Family members in your castle at the time of the attack.<br /><br />If there are two members of the Royal Family in your castle, you will reduce their castle hit points by two. If there are three, you will reduce it by three. Since there are only three cards (K, Q, J) that can be in the Royal Family, max damage against a castle is three.

- **Damaging a castle:** If a player damages an opponent's castle, they can do one of two things, if applicable:
  - 1. They may 'kidnap' an opponent's Royal Family member and take them back to their own castle.
  - 1. They may rescue any kidnapped family member of their own color, and return them to their own castle.

##### Assassin Card Actions (2's)

- **Assassinate:** If a two card of any suit is face-up in one of the piles, you may use that card to assassinate any family member in your opponent's castle. If your opponent does not have any family members in their castle, you cannot pick up the two card for any reason. When a family member is assassinated, both the two card and the family member card are destroyed and placed in the face-down discard pile.

- **Surprised!:** If a player draws from the deck and pulls a two card of any suit, they must destroy one of their own family members from an active castle. If that player does not have a family member in play, they must reduce their castle's hit points by one. After this is completed, destroy the two card, along with any family member card that was removed, and place them in the face-down discard pile.

##### Castle Cards (Ace)

If you draw your ally's castle card from either the deck or from a face-up pile, you may put that castle into play. Your new castle is considered *'being built'* and cannot be activated until you draw the hit point card (10) of the same suit.

Once your castle is activated, you can treat your new castle exactly as your old. You can use that suit to attack or fortify, and can gather your Royal Family. You can also capture your opponent's Royal Family and keep them in your new castle.

Once this new castle is activated, both castles must be destroyed for you to lose. If your new castle is still *'being built'* while your primary castle is destroyed, you lose. A castle cannot be considered active for the victory conditions if there is no hit point card attached.

##### This Section is currently under construction:
*Royal Family Card Actions (King, Queen, Jack):*
1. **Bring Home:** If the card **matches the suit of a castle in your possession**, you may place it in on top of **that** castle (leave the Ace showing a bit out the top of the face card). That family member adds one of the following benefits:
  - **King - "Morale"**: When the King is home the whole kingdom gets a morale boost.
    - The defending army fights harder. **All of your fortifications gain +2 in the king's matching castle.**
    - The alliance army helps defend. **You may use your alliance family cards to fortify the king's matching castle.**
  - **Queen - "Hospitality"** - The Queen is a master of politics.
    - The Queen knows that even in war you must treat your enemies with respect. She treats the kidnapped royal family members as they deserve; like royalty. **You may kidnap up to three opponent family members in the queen's matching castle instead of just one.**
    - The Queen casts doubt into the alliance of her enemy. **The opponent's alliance cards are affected ???**
  - **Jack - "Cunning"** - The Prince's youthful cunning nature extends to his war plans.
    - His strategies are flexible and make use of deceitful and creative attacks. **You can attack with either suit of the opponent's color.**
    - His attacks are fierce: **All attacks of the suit matching the attacked castle gain +1.**
2. **Kidnap:** If the card **matches the suit of an opponent castle**, you may place it below (not under) one of your castles. You may only kidnap one person per castle (unless you have the Queen). If you already have the max allowed kidnapped, you can choose which to keep kidnapped and which to release (discard). The opponent will have a chance to rescue the family member when they attack. Read the Attack section.
3. **Discard:** If you don't want to or can't do the other actions, then you may place the card on one of the three face-up piles between the two castles.

##### Castle Card Actions (Ace)

Take one of the following actions:

- **Inspire Another Kingdom + Extra Turn:** If the suit is your alliance family's suit, you may place it next to your first castle. Then take an extra turn. You now have two castles. You can do all the things to the 2nd that you could do to the first. The opponent must now destroy both to win.
- **Discard + Extra Turn:** If the suit **matches your opponent color** you discard it. Then take an extra turn. Perhaps this is a good chance to cover that castle up with another card ;) but you don't have to.
