# Royal-Family

An open source table top games that requires only a normal deck of cards

#### Players: 2

### Setup: 

1. Get a normal 52 count card deck. Keep the Jokers in the deck.
1. Each player starts with a castle (Ace card):
  - Player One starts with a black castle placed in front of them (Ace of Spades). This is the $COOLNAME$ family, their crest is the Spade &#9824;.
  - Player Two starts with a red castle placed in front of them (Ace of Hearts). This is the $COOLNAME$ family, their crest is the Heart &#9825;.
1. Shuffle the remaining deck.
1. Deal three (3) cards from the top of the deck. Place them between the two the castles and the deck to the side of the three cards as follows:

```
           Ace 1
     
DECK | ?1 | ?2 | ?3

           Ace 2
```

### Objective

A player wins when they complete one of the objectives:
- Destroy all opponent castles
- Populate a castle (A) with a full royal family (K, Q, J)

### Game Play

Players take turns. 

##### On a player's turn they:

1. Draw: Take one card from any of the three face-up card piles OR the face-down deck.
2. Take One Action, see next section.

##### Number Card Actions (2â€“10):
1. **Fortify a castle:** If you've drawn a number card that **matches the suit of a castle** in your possession, you may place it behind **that** castle (with the number sticking out a bit at the top) to fortify the castle. This will help protect against future attacks.
1. **Attack a castle:** You must have at least one family member present in your castle to be able to attack *(?? Maybe you don't need anyone to be able to attack)*. If you do, then if you've drawn a number card that **matches the suit of an opponent castle** *(?? maybe you have to attack with your own suit instead)*, you can declare an attack on the other player's castle. Hand them the card and have them resolve the attack, see next sub-section.
  - **Resolving an Attack:** The attacked player resolves the attack. They either:
    - **Defend:** Use a number card that is currently fortifying the attacked castle to cancel out the attack. The fortification card must be equal or greater than the attack number card.
    - **Take Castle Damage:** If the player cannot **Defend** then they place the attack number card to the side of the castle card. The castle now has that number of damage. When a castle take 20 (??) damage it is destroyed.
1. **Discard:** If the player doesn't want to or can't fortify or attack, they must discard the card. To discard, place the card face up on one of the three piles between the castles. 

##### Face Card Actions (Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Joker):
