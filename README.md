# Royal Family

Two royal families race to destroy each other. An open source table top game that requires only a normal deck of cards.

**This game is designed for two players.**

### Setup
1. Get a normal 52 count card deck. Keep the Jokers in the deck.
1. Each player starts with a castle (Ace card) and a hit point tracker (Ten card):
  - Player One starts with a black castle placed in front of them (Ace of Spades). They then place their hit point marker (Ten of Spades) in front of their castle. This is the Darklein family, their crest is the Spade &#9824;. The crest of their alliance family is the Club &#9827;.
  - Player Two starts with a red castle placed in front of them (Ace of Hearts). They then place their hit point marker (Ten of Hearts) in front of their castle. This is the Bludgein family, their crest is the Heart &#9825;. The crest of their alliance family is the Diamond &#9826;.
1. Shuffle the remaining cards.
1. Place three cards face-up. First turn is decided by these cards. Whichever color has a minority in these three cards gets first turn.

### Objective
Destroy all opponent castles. If a player has no castles active, they lose.

### Turn Order

This is a game of oppression and revolution. Each round, there will be a shift in power. This means one turn will have the Darklein family having more power, the next round the Bludgein family.

The game is divided into rounds. Between each round, three new cards are drawn from the deck. These are placed on each face-up pile. A round consists of three turns. Each player takes either one or two turns during a round. Turn order is as follows:
- Whichever player has a minority in the first drawn cards gets first turn. This will be *Player A*.
- *Player A* will take their turn. They can choose to pick up a face-up card or draw from the deck. Based on the card drawn, *Player A* will have options on what action to take (see actions below).
- Following *Player A's* actions, *Player B* will also either pick up one of the face-up cards or draw from the deck. They will also complete an action based on the card drawn.
- Following *Player B's* actions, *Player A* will again take their turn, the same process as before.
- Once three turns have been completed, three cards are drawn from the deck and placed face-up on the three piles. This starts a new round.
- Since *Player A* had two turns the previous round, *Player B* will now have two turns. This round, therefore, starts with *Player B* choosing a card, completing an action, followed by *Player A* doing the same, then *Player B* again.
- Following the three completed turns, three cards are again drawn, one placed face-up on each pile.
- Play continues on in this manner until either player has no castles in play.

### Game Concepts

##### Castles
The objective of the game is to destroy your opponent's castles. Castles are destroyed when their matching hit point card is reduced to zero. In order to reduce the value of the hit point card, an attacker must draw a card that allows them to attack while they have Royal Family members in their own castle and while the castle being attacked has no fortifications.

##### Fortifications
Fortifications can be placed in front of a castle to protect it from being attacked. If there is a fortification in place, a castle can take no damage. Fortifications are represented by number cards and are of the same value. Each castle can have one fortification in place. When attacked, the value of the fortification is reduced by the value of the attacker's card. When a fortification takes enough damage to reduce the value to zero, the fortification is destroyed and discarded.

##### Royal Family
Royal Families are the King, Queen, and Jack of a specific suit. A Royal Family can only reside in a castle of their corresponding suit. Having one of the cards in your castle allows you to damage your opponent's castle. The damage done is based not on the attacking troops, but on the number of Royal Family currently in your castle.

**Example:** The Darklein family currently has their Queen and Jack residing in the castle. The Bludgein family has no fortified troops in place and the Darkleins are able to attack. Since the Bludgein family cannot defend the attack, their castle takes two damage – one for the Queen and one for the Jack. The Bludgein player reduces their castle hit points from ten to eight.

In addition to determining attack strength, the Royal Family cards bring with them abilities which can be performed during a player turn. *These are in the works*

### Game Play Mechanics

Rounds consist of three turns. A player will take one or two turns during a round. Between each round, a new card is drawn from the deck and placed face-up on each pile.

**Turn Order Sample:**
1. Game begins with *Player A* having minority of drawn cards. Takes first turn.
1. *Player B* takes turn two.
1. *Player A* takes turn three.
1. Three new cards are drawn and placed on the face-up piles. One card on each pile.
1. *Player B* takes the first turn.
1. *Player A* takes the second turn.
1. *Player B* takes the third turn.
1. Three new cards are drawn and placed on the face-up piles. One card on each pile.
1. *Player A* will take first turn, then *Player B*, then *Player A*.
1. Play continues in this fashion until either player has no castles in play.

##### On a player's turn they can do the following:

1. Draw: Take one card from either the deck or one of the face-up piles. Available actions are based on the card drawn.
2. Use an ability.

### Actions

##### Number Card Actions (3–9):

Number cards represent the troops of a given family. These troops can be sent out against an opponent, or can be used to fortify a castle. A player may use a number card ranging from 3 to 9 if that number card **matches the suit of a castle the player currently has active**.

- **Fortify a castle:** A player may use a number card ranging from 3 to 9 to fortify the castle of the same suit. A castle may only have one fortification in place at any point. If a castle has a fortification already in place, the player may discard that fortification and replace it with the drawn card. The castle must be active to hold a fortification.<br /><br />Fortifications can be attacked. When this happens, the value of the fortification is reduced from the value of the number card by the amount of the attacker's number card. When a fortification reaches a value of zero (or below), it is destroyed and placed in a face-down discard pile.

- **Attack a fortification:** If your opponent has a fortification in place, you may use your troops to attack their fortification. The value of the attack is determined by the card being used to attack. The opponent's fortification is reduced by that amount. Following the attack, the attacking card is destroyed and placed in the face-down discard pile. If the fortification value is reduced to zero (or below), it is also destroyed and placed in the face-down discard pile.

- **Attack a castle:** If your opponent does not have a fortification in place and you currently have at least one member of your Royal Family residing in the attacking castle, you may attack their castle. Damage done to an opponent's castle is determined not by the value of your troops card, but by the number of Royal Family members in your castle at the time of the attack.

If there are two members of the Royal Family in your castle, you will reduce their castle hit points by two. If there are three, you will reduce it by three. Since there are only three cards (K, Q, J) that can be in the Royal Family, max damage against a castle is three.

**Damaging a castle:** If a player damages an opponent's castle, they can do one of two things, if applicable:
1. They may 'kidnap' an opponent's Royal Family member and take them back to their own castle.
1. They may rescue any kidnapped family member of their own color, and return them to their own castle.

##### Assassin Card Actions (2's)

- **Assassinate:** If a two card of any suit is face-up in one of the piles, you may use that card to assassinate any family member in your opponent's castle. If your opponent does not have any family members in their castle, you cannot pick up the two card for any reason. When a family member is assassinated, both the two card and the family member card are destroyed and placed in the face-down discard pile.

- **Surprised!:** If a player draws from the deck and pulls a two card of any suit, they must destroy one of their own family members from an active castle. If that player does not have a family member in play, they must reduce their castle's hit points by one. After this is completed, destroy the two card, along with any family member card that was removed, and place them in the face-down discard pile.

##### Castle Cards (Ace)

If you draw your ally's castle card from either the deck or from a face-up pile, you may put that castle into play. Your new castle is considered *'being built'* and cannot be activated until you draw the hit point card (10) of the same suit.

Once your castle is activated, you can treat your new castle exactly as your old. You can use that suit to attack or fortify, and can gather your Royal Family. You can also capture your opponent's Royal Family and keep them in your new castle.

Once this new castle is activated, both castles must be destroyed for you to lose. If your new castle is still *'being built'* while your primary castle is destroyed, you lose. A castle cannot be considered active for the victory conditions if there is no hit point card attached.

*Royal Family Card Actions (King, Queen, Jack):*
1. **Bring Home:** If the card **matches the suit of a castle in your possession**, you may place it in on top of **that** castle (leave the Ace showing a bit out the top of the face card). That family member adds one of the following benefits:
  - **King - "Morale"**: When the King is home the whole kingdom gets a morale boost.
    - The defending army fights harder. **All of your fortifications gain +2 in the king's matching castle.**
    - The alliance army helps defend. **You may use your alliance family cards to fortify the king's matching castle.**
  - **Queen - "Hospitality"** - The Queen is a master of politics.
    - The Queen knows that even in war you must treat your enemies with respect. She treats the kidnapped royal family members as they deserve; like royalty. **You may kidnap up to three opponent family members in the queen's matching castle instead of just one.**
    - The Queen casts doubt into the alliance of her enemy. **The opponent's alliance cards are affected ???**
  - **Jack - "Cunning"** - The Prince's youthful cunning nature extends to his war plans.
    - His strategies are flexible and make use of deceitful and creative attacks. **You can attack with either suit of the opponent's color.**
    - His attacks are fierce: **All attacks of the suit matching the attacked castle gain +1.**
2. **Kidnap:** If the card **matches the suit of an opponent castle**, you may place it below (not under) one of your castles. You may only kidnap one person per castle (unless you have the Queen). If you already have the max allowed kidnapped, you can choose which to keep kidnapped and which to release (discard). The opponent will have a chance to rescue the family member when they attack. Read the Attack section.
3. **Discard:** If you don't want to or can't do the other actions, then you may place the card on one of the three face-up piles between the two castles.

##### Castle Card Actions (Ace)

Take one of the following actions:

- **Inspire Another Kingdom + Extra Turn:** If the suit is your alliance family's suit, you may place it next to your first castle. Then take an extra turn. You now have two castles. You can do all the things to the 2nd that you could do to the first. The opponent must now destroy both to win.
- **Discard + Extra Turn:** If the suit **matches your opponent color** you discard it. Then take an extra turn. Perhaps this is a good chance to cover that castle up with another card ;) but you don't have to.
